Built with React on the frontend and Ruby on Rails on the backend, this project allows users to view all images, mark individual images as foaming, non-foaming, or unclassified, and filter images depending on whether they are foaming, non-foaming, or unclassified. 

To improve user experience, results are paginated so only 100 images are displayed on each page. In addition, while users are viewing individual images, they are able to use their left and right arrow key to view the next or previous image. Lastly, to ensure efficiency and productivity, unclassified images are distinctly marked with a yellow border to draw greater attention to them.
